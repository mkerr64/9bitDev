This Project is for the course CS2212, Introduction to Software Engineering, at The University of Western Ontario.

We intend to create a web based financial planning product that will track spending habits and offer advice based 
on the user's spending habits. Users will be able to input their transactions and categorize them. Expenses will 
be analyzed and displayed along with visual representations of their spending.
