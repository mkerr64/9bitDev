[Home](README.md)   

### Home/Dashboard
The dashboard is the home page of our app, where an overview of the user’s data can be seen. In the centre of this screen is be a pie chart of the user’s spending, with different colours corresponding to different categories. Three buttons, labeled “daily”, “weekly”, and “monthly”, are directly below the pie chart and can be pressed to view the average spending for the selected period. Beside the chart are the specific data points for each category.    

Additionally, new transactions can be entered in a field under the pie chart, and budgeting tips are displayed in the corner of the screen.   

- overview of all budgeting, pie chart of spending
- information for pie chart next to it
- user input updates shown under pie chart
- budgeting tips in the corner

### Budget
The budget screen is where the user can set and change their monthly income. The user can also input their expenses and other transactions in order to track their spending habits, which will be displayed on the dashboard. To facilitate this tracking, bar graphs of the top spending categories will also be included on the dashboard to aid the user in understanding their spending habits.    

- summary of top spending categories
- input for new transaction
- ability to change savings goal and monthly income
- after inputting transaction/making changes to settings, dashboard will update based on changed info 

### Rewards/Achievements
The game page keeps track of the user's achievements and rewards. For instance, as a reward for sticking to a budget limit for a week, an achievement may fill up as the week progresses, and finally unlock when the week is over. However, rewards are planned as an additional feature that will only be implemented if time permits.    

- achievements include: creating account, adding first transaction, adding 5 transactions
- rewards system
- achievements or encouragement messages
- budget comparison

## MOCKUPS   
The UI was designed with a flat, minimalist design in mind. Shades such as shadow and colour choice were inspired by Material Design. The overall aesthetic was made with elements of mobile patterns, in order to be easily used and ported to mobile platforms.     

Navigation done through sidebar.      
 
PROGRAMS USED: paint.NET, Photoshop CS5
